            <p>Olathe is located in eastern Kansas near Kansas City and the Missouri border. It is southwest of Kansas City and near Lenexa, Overland Park, De Soto, and Gardner.
                Olathe was founded in 1857 by Dr. John T. Barton. Olathe means "beautiful" in the native Shawnee language.

            <img src="/images/load.jpg" data-src="../images/bleedingkansas.jpg" alt="bleeding kansas">
            <p>Olathe was caught in the legality of slavery conflict known as Bleeding Kansas within the first few years it was founded. It took until 1865 for the Olathe military
                post to be decomissioned.</p>

        <div class="discoverImgDiv">
            <img src="/images/load.jpg" data-src="../images/oregontrail.jpg" alt="trail stop">
            <p>One of the most important purposes of Olathe was its usage as a stop on multiple major trails. The Oregon, California, and Santa Fe trails all passed through Olathe and 
                travelers resupplied and rested here often.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="discoverImgDiv">
            <img src="/images/load.jpg" data-src="../images/mahaffie.jpg" alt="mahaffie historic site">
            <p>The Mahaffie House was a popular resupply location for travelers on the major trails. Today it serves as a historical site that features costumes, stagecoach rides, animals, 
                re-enactments, and other activities from that time period.
            </p>

        <div class="discoverImgDiv">
            <img src="/images/load.jpg" data-src="../images/35.png" alt="highways and growth">
            <p>Once the transcontinental railroad was built, the trails lost some of their relevance and, therefore, so did Olathe. The town stayed stagnant in its growth but 
                did not fade away completely.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="discoverImgDiv">
            <img src="/images/load.jpg" data-src="../images/olathe.png" alt="growth and best place to live">
            <p>Interstate highways played a role in Olathe's growth due to its proximity to Kansas City. The entire metropolitan area grew and naturally, so did Olathe. In 2008
                Olathe was ranked as the 24th fastest growing city in the nation and 11th in a list of the 100 best cities to live in the U.S.

        <div class="discoverImgDiv">
            <img src="/images/load.jpg" data-src="../images/farm.jpg" alt="economy">
            <p>Olathe has an excess of farmland and prairie to the north, south, and west and produces many crops. Another key element to Olathe's economy are the corporate districts.
                For example, Olathe employs the most employees for Farmers Insurance Group than any other city in the U.S. despite the company being based in Los Angeles.
            </p>

        <div class="discoverImgDiv">
            <img src="/images/load.jpg" data-src="../images/lakepark.jpg" alt="lakes and parks">
            <p>Despite having a fairly strong corporate presence, Olathe has an incredible number of parks and trails to offer to visitors. Some trails span across muiltiple
                cities and provide great outdoor fun and exercise. Olathe is also home to two major lakes, Lake Olathe and Cedar Lake.
